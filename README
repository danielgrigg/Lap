LAP

Install using rcmake

ruby rcmake.rb

LAP is a work in progress*, but provides a set of primitive operations for processing triangles meshes.
Application wise lapquery is probably the most interesting atm.

In time LAP will live up to its acronym as a full asset pipeline, just no guarantees about it being on 
github.

*and partly an experiment, 'what if I rewrote some existing code more generically?' behold the result, 
lots and lots of little functions and adapters and massive improvement on its counterpart.
